# Sail usability personas and test protocol

These are **hypothesis personas** for repeatable expert walkthroughs, not interviews or evidence from real users. Each tester starts with a fresh app profile and a disposable Git repository. Record the OS, Sail commit, available agents, starting state, action sequence, visible result, screenshots or accessibility output, and severity. Mark a task **blocked by environment** when an external agent, provider, or plugin is unavailable; do not call it a product failure without reproducing the product behavior.

**Current priority:** project grouping, worktree creation and removal, and agent conversations scoped to the selected worktree. Test these before secondary layout checks. Compare the interaction with [Orca's worktree lifecycle](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/model/worktrees) and [first three-agent session](https://www.onorca.dev/docs/first-session): add repo → create isolated worktree → start an agent in it → switch/review → clean up. Sail does not need Orca's full feature set for this audit, but each gap in this core path should be recorded.

The scenarios state goals without naming Sail controls. This follows [NN/g's task scenario guidance](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/task-scenarios-usability-testing/) and [usability testing guidance](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-testing-101/). Evaluate feedback, recovery, and discoverability against [NN/g's usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Accessibility checks use [WCAG 2.2 keyboard operation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard), [focus visibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible), and [dragging alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements).

## Maya — AI power user

- **Context:** Senior engineer who runs several agents, reviews plans before execution, and switches between code and conversation.
- **Goal:** Stay aware of what the agent is doing and interrupt it without losing work.
- **Scenario:** Plan a small change in a disposable repository. Inspect its diagram and individual steps, request one revision, then inspect the resulting changes. Start a second agent conversation and stop an answer in progress.
- **Observe:** Working versus idle status; timing and clarity of progress updates; whether plan edits and drafts survive panel switches; whether the diagram can be read; whether Changes reflects current Git state after a revert; whether Escape stops the active agent without deleting the conversation.
- **Success:** Each state and action is discoverable from the UI, the displayed diff matches Git, and switching or stopping preserves prior work.

## Alex — first-time user

- **Context:** Understands a local repository but has never used OpenCode, ACP, or a planning plugin.
- **Goal:** Start useful work without external coaching.
- **Scenario:** Open Sail with a repository, discover what is needed to begin, ask for a plan, then return after a restart. Repeat with a missing or invalid runtime dependency.
- **Observe:** Whether labels and setup instructions explain the next action; whether the runtime path is findable in settings; whether progress differs visibly from a stuck state; whether errors state how to recover; whether repository, session, and preferences return after restart.
- **Success:** The path to first plan is understandable when prerequisites exist. Missing prerequisites have a specific, visible repair step. Saved context returns.

## Jordan — multi-repository maintainer

- **Context:** Works across several repositories and uses worktrees to isolate tasks.
- **Goal:** Navigate quickly without editing or deleting the wrong checkout.
- **Scenario:** Organize two repositories under a named project, make a separate checkout for a task, switch among repositories and worktrees, then remove an obsolete checkout. Try removal once with an uncommitted file.
- **Observe:** Sidebar grouping and selected location; worktree dialog, destination, and base branch; session isolation on switches; deletion confirmation, dirty-file protection, and the resulting Git/workspace state.
- **Success:** Selection always names the correct path; created worktrees live in the Sail workspace; dirty deletion is refused clearly; clean deletion removes exactly the chosen worktree.

## Sam — keyboard and low-vision user

- **Context:** Uses keyboard navigation and enlarged content; precise dragging is difficult.
- **Goal:** Review the same work without relying on pointer precision.
- **Scenario:** Enlarge the UI, move between projects and the plan, open a diagram for reading, give feedback on a plan, resize the plan area, and inspect and dismiss Changes.
- **Observe:** Tab order, visible focus, accessible names, keyboard reachability and escape routes, readable text and diagrams at larger scale, resize keyboard steps and a pointer alternative, status messages, and focus after dialogs close.
- **Success:** Essential tasks remain usable with keyboard and enlarged UI, with no focus trap or unexpected jump. Resizing does not require dragging.

## Reporting

For each persona, report completed tasks, blocked tasks, and findings with exact steps, expected and actual behavior, screenshot or accessibility evidence, severity, and affected commit. Treat simulated-persona findings as an expert audit; validate high-impact findings with real users when available.
